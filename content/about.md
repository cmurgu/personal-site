I grew up in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, a stone's throw from Detroit, Michigan. I studied History at the University of Windsor and McGill University in Montreal. In September 2016, I moved to London, Canada to study Library Science at Western University. From May to December 2017 I worked in Bibliometrics at the University of Waterloo. I am currently a Librarian working in digital scholarship and instruction at the <a href="https://www.ncf.edu/">New College of Florida</a>. Among other initiatives, I coordinate the <a href="https://dss.ncf.edu/main">Digital Schoalrship Studio</a>. Though I divide my time between Windsor and Sarasota, I feel most at home in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Essex+County,+ON,+Canada/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x882fffea1fcd2cc3:0x4e2308cfe371ed1?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi5h8az7PjiAhWCylkKHZjZAOoQ8gEwFHoECA8QBA">Essex County</a>.
