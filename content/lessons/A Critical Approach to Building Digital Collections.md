## HUMN Bodies and Minds Group Project

For this assignment you’ll be using CollectionBuilder, an open-source tool for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology, and Github, a free repository service, to create your own digital collections of archival material. Our archival material will be sourced from the Ringling Archives (special thanks to the Ringling Archives staff for supporting this assignment).
Over the course of several in-class sessions, in collaboration with Cal Murgu, DH Librarian, your group will use CollectionBuilder to develop online exhibitions of selected archival material, including prints, photographs, and scrapbooks. While website shells will be created for you, you will be required to customize your website.

Learning Outcomes  
• Students will learn about the archival and digital collection lifecycle, from analog collections and description to their digital surrogates  
• Students will gain an understanding of the basics of Github  
• Students will gain an understanding of the basics of Markdown  
• Students will gain an understanding of static web technology

## Assignment  
Your group will be assigned a relatively small archival collection. You will be asked to complete the following:

1) describe this material in your group spreadsheet using specific metadata fields. Consider the following questions:  
a. Is there an author?  
b. Is there a publisher?  
c. When was the item in question created?  
d. What is the physical description of the item? What does the item speak to or describe?);  
2) digitize the material using a DSLR/scanner and some patience;
3) arrange the material appropriately;
4) upload your metadata and digitized material to your CollectionBuilder site;
5) complete your website by configuring it.

Digital Humanities Librarian Cal Murgu (cmurgu@ncf.edu) will be available throughout the assignment period for consultation. You are encouraged to work with him on this project. Digital projects are invariably collaborative endeavors, so you are encouraged to ask for help when/where you need it. Try not to wait until the last minute to ask for assistance.
