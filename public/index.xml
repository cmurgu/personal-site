      <description>I grew up in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw from Detroit, Michigan. I studied History at the University of Windsor and McGill University in Montreal. In September 2016, I moved to London, Canada to study at Western University. From May to December 2017 I worked at the University of Waterloo. I am currently a Librarian working in digital scholarship and instruction at the New College of Florida. Though I divide my time between Windsor and Sarasota, I feel most at home in Essex County.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s time to go, Jeff</title>

      <description>When Jeffrey Beall retired from the Auroria Library at the University of Colorado at Denver in March 2018, half of the scholarly publishing world applauded him for his efforts against &amp;ldquo;predatory publishers.&amp;rdquo; The other half let out a massive sigh of relief. Beall&amp;rsquo;s retirement succeeded a prolonged period of scandal in some academic circles.
In the years leading up to his retirement, Beall began to receive increasingly negative attention for his now infamous &amp;ldquo;Beall&amp;rsquo;s list,&amp;rdquo; a blacklist of potentially predatory publishers that he himself had curated since 2008 (presumably on his free time, and not while working at the Auroria Library).</description>

      <title>On library jobs</title>

      <description>This post is primarily for graduate students in LIS that are looking for some anecdotal information about what it’s like to look for work in the information field. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty nasty proposition. In general, this post is like many others in an emerging genre, prompted by Melanie Stefan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;A CV of Failures&amp;rdquo; and Johanes Haushofer&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CV of Failures,&amp;rdquo; which attempt to shine a spotlight on all of the things academics apply for and fail to get, be it a grant, scholarship, publication, or job.</description>

      <title>On Conflating Values</title>
      <link>https://calmurgu.com/posts/2017/07/on-conflating-values/</link>

      <description>And so, given their pervasive nature and ability “to foster broad changes, both intended and unintended, in the activities that they monitor, social measures deserve closer scholarly attention.” It seems that we have embraced, albeit to different degrees, the practice of ranking institutional repositories. I find this development problematic because it extends the language and logic of markets to an initiative that has heretofore been fueled by magnanimity, author rights, and social justice, first, and capital, second.</description>

      <title>On Metrics and Acknowledgement Texts</title>
      <link>https://calmurgu.com/posts/2017/06/on-metrics-and-acknowledgement-texts/</link>

      <description>===
At first glance, these metrics are innocuous. In an increasingly austere environment, measurement and quantitative evaluation have become part and parcel of the machinery of academia at all levels, normalized for provosts, students, and everyone in between. However, having given this a little more thought, I think that the most sinister thing about these metrics is that they&amp;rsquo;re increasingly being self-imposed; that is, governments, in an act of &amp;lsquo;magnanimity&amp;rsquo;, are encouraging institutions to identify which measures they&amp;rsquo;d like to be held to account on.</description>

      <title>Mother tongues</title>

      <description>When I was about 8 or 9 I renounced Romanian and began to think and dream exclusively in English. To renounce my mother tongue was an active decision. I remember the day that I said to myself, &amp;ldquo;English is my language now and I must learn it and embrace it.&amp;rdquo; I said this immediately following a spelling test in which I misspelled &amp;ldquo;Dad&amp;rdquo;; I wrote down &amp;ldquo;Dod.&amp;rdquo; I had just started school.</description>

      <description>This post was originally published as a MediaCommons Field Guide. You can read the original, along with other responses on the question of the future of the archive, here. 
I’ll start off by disclosing that I am not an archivist; my perspective is informed by the time I’ve spent in archives as a researcher, and the work that I’ve been doing recently on digital historiography. In a way, I’m an outsider looking in.</description>

      <title>The new Trump Library</title>

      <description>About three weeks ago, back when the world made sense and talk of Donald Trump in the Oval Office was almost exclusively preceded by a “wouldn’t it be hilarious if,” Robert Darnton, Carl H. Pforzheimer University Professor and University Librarian Emeritus at Harvard, mused about the future of the Library of Congress in a Clinton administration. “When the new president, if she is Hillary Clinton, moves into the White House,” asks Darnton, “will she unpack her library in the spirit of Walter Benjamin—releasing memories of adventures attached to books?</description>
