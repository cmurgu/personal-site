      <description>To avoid being what seemed at the time like the last person on Twitter to not know how to make sourdough bread, I embarked on a bit of a journey. I wanted to start and take care of a sourdough culture (what some have called a new ‚Äî but very, very old ‚Äî Tamagotchi) and bake some tasty bread with it. What you see above is the first of several failed attempts at sourdough baking.</description>

      <description>The job market for positions in academic librarianship has never been particularly great, but COVID19 promises to shake up hiring across higher-ed.
This page tracks the number of academic library positions posted on ALA Job Board and the Canadian Partnership job site. While these two sites do not represent a complete list of available positions, they&#39;re arguably the most popular job websites for Canadian and American academic library roles. Historical job data is difficult to find, so comparing M or YTD is challenging, but using the data collected by the folks at LIS Precarity I compare the number of jobs available today to that of last year.</description>

      <description>I like many things about being an academic librarian: the freedom to explore interesting and creative topics with students and other faculty; the latitude to create programs and programming; the thrill and excitement of instruction; creating new digital objects; constantly having to learn new things and methods. I could go on.
I also dislike a few things about being an academic librarian. LibGuides, for instance (sorry not sorry), are near the top of that list.</description>

      <title>Representing Sentiment Scores of Specific Locations with Original Music. An exercise in musicdh</title>

      <description>In Spring 2020, I had the opportunity to co-sponsor an independent study project for 2nd year student at New College. The objective seemed simple enough: study the intersection of music and the digital humanities and produce a project that represents that intersection. It seems to me that the fields of musicology and music composition have not been affected by the digital humanities to the same degree as other fields. With respect to the latter, perhaps this is because composition turned towards the digital decades ago.</description>

      <title>Confessions of a reformed Omeka acolyte. Minimalist options for digital exhibitions</title>

      <description>While a Digital Projects Coordinator at the University of Windsor in 2015-16, I remember thinking that Omeka would revolutionize the way we create and teach about digital exhibits, metadata, and the subtle acts involved in digital collecting. Here was a relatively lightweight CMS that enabled us to spin up new instances almost immediately. With set-up a breeze, we could focus our attention on the intellectual work of arrangement, description, and narrative.</description>
