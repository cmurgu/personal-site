            <div class="post-content">
                <p>When I was about 8 or 9 I renounced Romanian and began to think and dream exclusively in English. To renounce my mother tongue was an active decision. I remember the day that I said to myself, &ldquo;English is my language now and I must learn it and embrace it.&rdquo; I said this immediately following a spelling test in which I misspelled &ldquo;Dad&rdquo;; I wrote down &ldquo;Dod.&rdquo; I had just started school. What was I thinking? I was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->over<!-- raw HTML omitted -->thinking, in the wrong language. For me North America was a new world—and in this new world English was the key: the key to community, the key to networks, the key to sociality, the key to friendship, the key to culture, the key to citizenship, the key to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everything<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>And besides, I could not write well in Romanian; I struggled with grammar and felt as though I was always behind. I was only 7. People would tell me that Romanian &ldquo;is an easy language because it's phonetic and it has very strict rules. You just need to memorize the rules.&rdquo; I could not memorize the rules. Nevertheless, I could speak it fairly well and it was the language I used to think and articulate my thoughts. I recall taking private English lessons with a pleasant man sporting a Tom Selleck moustache. He would have me watch cartoons and we would translate words together and my parents would pay him and I gather they thought I was well on my way to mastering the language; they did not know at the time that I would go on to misspell &ldquo;Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I embraced English as the language of my thoughts and dreams, but there are times when English continues to be a foreign language to me. Sometimes, when I sit down to write, I feel as though we are completely estranged. It is often a bitter struggle and it's why this blog exist (but if my publishing rate is any indication&hellip;) Why is every paragraph a fight, every essay an internal scrap? Would I have a mastery of the metaphor had English been my mother tongue? Would I still need thesaurus.com and Google tabs at the ready to help me find the correct word to articulate a thought? Would I still consider my prose prosaic and flat, neither elegant nor sophisticated?</p>
<p>There is another consequence to abandoning a mother tongue. Yiyun Li recently wrote a moving personal history for the New Yorker titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;To Speak is to Blunder.&ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It's beautiful and delicate, and you should read it. In it she describes what it was like to abandon Chinese and embrace English as  her &ldquo;public and private language.&rdquo; The following excerpt struck me: &ldquo;Over the years, my brain has banished Chinese. I dream in English. I talk to myself in English. And memories—not only those about America but also those about China—are sorted in English.&rdquo; Renouncing a language affects the way that you recall memories. What does that mean? When I recall a memory I build the scene in English. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There was a chair and a table and he was there and she was sitting and they were talking and music was playing. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Romanian memories should be remembered in Romanian but I build them in English, too. &ldquo;When one remembers in an adopted language,&rdquo; writes Li, &ldquo;there is a dividing line in the remembrance. What came before could be someone else's life; it might as well be fiction.&rdquo; What happened before, then, is mediated by this other language that is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at once<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mine and not mine. I'll let Li have the last words because they are perfect, and I wish I had written them: &ldquo;One's relationship with the native language is similar to that with the past. Rarely does a story start where we wish it had, or end where we wish it would.&rdquo;</p>
