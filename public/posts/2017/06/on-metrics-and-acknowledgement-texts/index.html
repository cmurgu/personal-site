<p>At first glance, these metrics are innocuous. In an increasingly austere environment, measurement and quantitative evaluation have become part and parcel of the machinery of academia at all levels, normalized for provosts, students, and everyone in between. However, having given this a little more thought, I think that the most sinister thing about these metrics is that they're increasingly being self-imposed; that is, governments, in an act of &lsquo;magnanimity&rsquo;, are encouraging institutions to identify which measures they'd like to be held to account on. Having received the proverbial carrot, we seem to have shifted the conversation away from &lsquo;why must we measure?&rsquo; to &lsquo;fine, which measures shall we highlight?&rsquo; I’d like to concentrate on the third aforementioned metric (“Average number of research-funded collaborations/partnerships with industry, government, and NGOs”) for the remainder of this post, and approach it from a perspective informed by my experience in History and my current job as a librarian working in bibliometrics and research impact.</p>
<p>We all want to present the best version of ourselves<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->especially when funding is on the line; institutions of higher learning are no exception. As a result, when the onus of choosing which metrics should be highlighted falls on institutional shoulders, the natural inclination is to choose the ones that are most flattering. My institution is a world-class institution in STEM research and education (I throw around words like &lsquo;Quantum&rsquo; and &lsquo;Nano&rsquo; a few dozen times a day). The publishing culture in STEM fields embraced co-authorship and multi-author publications as the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->modus operandi<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->decades ago. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In most cases, the very nature of the research requires teams consisting of dozens of researchers, from across the world, doing a variety of tasks that I can't begin to explain. In other cases, individuals are included as authors as a token of gratitude for reading early manuscripts or as a showing of respect. It, therefore, makes sense that they'd highlight international collaboration as a worthwhile measure. The problem is that at some point, co-authorship alone became the standard way of measuring collaborative scholarship, international or otherwise (for studies on co-authorship in STEM see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this <!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A quick look at <em>Web of Science</em> data (I know this is an imperfect source, but just bear with me) illustrates how standardized measures of collaboration explicitly underprivileged those working in the Arts and Humanities, specifically History.</p>
<p><img src="%7B%7Bbase%7D%7D/images/physics.jpg" alt="Nuclear Physics international collab"></p>
<p><img src="%7B%7Bbase%7D%7D/images/engineering.jpg" alt="Engineering international collab"></p>
<p><img src="%7B%7Bbase%7D%7D/images/history.jpg" alt="History international collab"></p>
<p>These numbers should not be surprising. They represent two different cultures of publishing that I need not describe here. The problem is that, if we begin to subscribe to self-imposed institutional metrics that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->overwhelmingly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> privilege one publishing culture over another, what's to say that those metrics won't facilitate disproportionate or inequitable incentive structures at the faculty level? Again, the most sinister part of this scenario is that we'd be doing it to ourselves. I'm not blind to the realities of academia; measuring research impact and productivity are not capricious trends. We have two options, as I see it: we could dig our feet in the ground and rage against the dying of the light, choosing instead to not engage with metrics in any fashion; or, we could start to think of ways to express to administrators, librarians*, analysts and governments that the work we do is profoundly collaborative.</p>
<p>So, are historians collaborative? I turned to &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; in research articles published in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gender &amp; History <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Journal of Modern History <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to find out. I've always been interested in acknowledgement texts. Whether in books or research articles, I find that I learn a lot about the person whose work I'm about to engage with from the way that they express gratitude to young graduate students and colleagues (international or otherwise), show humility (or not), and communicate their love to their children and partners. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Applied Linguistics <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by Davide Simone Giannoni breaks apart &ldquo;acknowledgement texts&rdquo; into constitutive parts. As Giannoni writes, &ldquo;acknowledgements are staged texts with a coherent rationale governing their rhetorical construction.&rdquo; In general, through a &ldquo;socially-accepted communicative framework,&rdquo; authors articulate their debts &ldquo;with enough ambiguity to reconcile the public and private realms of discourse.&rdquo; Ultimately, &ldquo;if acknowledgements have been discounted as an exercise in flattery, this is largely due to their misuse and exclusion from the peer review process.&rdquo; This is a shame, given that &ldquo;the genre's formulaic, inventory-like appearance conceals a carefully worded rhetoric emphasizing academia's most prized values: cumulative knowledge and intellectual integrity&rdquo; [pg. 23-4]. Can you have these two things without collaboration?</p>
<p>My rushed analysis of an (admittedly anemic) sample of 33 articles published in the last year or so reveals that historians publishing in those journals are surprisingly collaborative, despite publishing as single authors. In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->G&amp;H, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->61% of authors acknowledged that their article would not have been possible were it not for significant edits, comments, and criticisms from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at least one <!-- raw HTML omitted -->colleague at an institution <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in a country different from their own<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (in some cases the author referenced three or more international collaborators).† In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JMH, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a similar result: 64% expressed that they were extremely grateful for suggestions, comments, and edits on early drafts of their articles from colleagues abroad. Here's what these acknowledgements, illustrated as lines or edges, look like on a map:</p>
<p><img src="%7B%7Bbase%7D%7D/images/map.jpg" alt="Map of relationships"></p>
<p>Obviously, I can't confirm just how extensive these collaborations ran, or if they are just &ldquo;exercises in flattery&rdquo;; nonetheless, I would ask the authors the following question: if the publishing culture in the humanities mirrored that of STEM fields, would you feel comfortable listing the colleague to which you expressed your gratitude as a secondary author?‡</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting that we crowd our acknowledgement texts with collaborators (though, I wonder if we should begin a process of reconceptualizing &lsquo;authorship&rsquo; in the humanities, to something like Blaise Cronin and others&rsquo; idea of associated &lsquo;contributorship&rsquo;). Not only are acknowledgements <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a metadata field in most commercial databases, but it would lead to the very same problem that we're seeing in STEM author fields. All of this is to say that we should not clock out at the very mention of measurement: we should pay close attention to the metrics that are chosen <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->us, and be present when given the chance to choose <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for ourselves. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>‡ Since writing this post I stumbled across Nadine Desrochers, Adele Paul-Hus, and Vincent Lariviere's chapter, &ldquo;The Angle Sum Theory: Exploring the Literature on Acknowledgements in Scholarly Communication,&rdquo; (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://crctcs.openum.ca/files/sites/60/2016/05/Desrochers_Paul-Hus_Lariviere_2016.pdf">http://crctcs.openum.ca/files/sites/60/2016/05/Desrochers_Paul-Hus_Lariviere_2016.pdf</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) in Cassidy Sugimoto's (ed)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Theories of Informetrics and Scholarly Communications <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(2016). They do a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->much <!-- raw HTML omitted -->better job explaining acknowledgement texts than I.</p>
